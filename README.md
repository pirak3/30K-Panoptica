Horus Heresy
============


## Overview ##
__What's this?__

This is the data repo for the Horus Heresy 2nd edition supplemented with Panoptica rules and units

BSData organisation created this project initially. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe or any other company/publisher. 
If you want to help please create a PR or issue so we can take a look.

We strongly recommend you use NewRecruit over Battlescribe, as battlescribe is abandonware.

__Why was this setup?__

I have been a long time user of the great repo set up [here](https://github.com/LeonisAstra/30K-4-All) but i ran into the issue that I could not use my mechanicum units. After much work trying to get the intial repo rebased and trying to add the new units I decided to start work on it from scratch. So this is a completely new project based upon the BSData repo with my own additions and inspiration from LeonIsAstra his repo.

__I found a bug!__ / *I have another request*

Great, thank you! Please [Report a bug][bug report] - you can also suggest enhancements and raise other issues there.

## Standards


### Creating units
#### Names
In general, we remove the "Legion" prefix from units, unless that unit has a non-legion equivalent such as Legion Baneblade

We create a unit entry for each unit, and a model entry within that unit (even if it's a single model unit).
This allows us to get an accurate model count and keeps everything consistent.

On UNITS we default them to hidden and add a modifier with constraint to set "Hidden to False" if "Equal to 1 selection in force of <> on". Ensure "And all child selections is checked".
On UPGRADES, we default the option to not hidden, and set "Hidden to True" if the "off" condition is selected.

#### Important reminders:
These are requirements on a unit to maintain rites of war:
- Solar Auxillia and Imperialis Militia units need "SA or IM Unit" for rites of war that count that number of units.
- - Lords of war should be excluded from this as they won't be in the "allied detachment"

### .cattemplate? and what are all the template_id_ comments?
A .cattemplate file is a .cat file, renamed to .cattemplate, used by [BSCOPY](https://github.com/nstephenh/BSCopy)

We used bscopy to copy all 18 legions after implementing the first one. 
We didn't maintain the template so it's not recommended to re-run bscopy

## Notes

I am working on this in my free time and mainly focussed on getting the panoptica rules actually used by my gaming group added first.

### Priority List

- Mechanicum
- Death Guard
- Imperial Fists
- Iron Warriors
- Custodes
- etc..
